# About AIBox

This is currently just a proof of concept.

The main purpose of these programming mini games is to play, learn and share. 

It is known there are already a trillion of coding challenge sites and events, even so I think some variations or combinations of their features could lead to something new. 

Lets see some highlights

## confortable tooling
Players will be able to code with their usual desktop tools. 

Code submissions could be done by pushing with git. 

Server runtime environment will be built with docker images allowing freedom and speed to include new languages or libraries. 

## feedback on results
All data from matches will be available for download by API. 

So it should be easy to analyze it with any tool or use for trainning models. 

## promote collaboration
A time after release a game will go into practice mode and all the submissions will be public.

Then any player will be able to fork and improve other submissions. 

Practice ranking will be apart from competitive one. So winner glory will be eternal anyways :)

Site code, game engines and submissions will be available under OSS license. 


## smooth learning curve
Games should be designed in a way that is beginner friendly, but having space to grow in complexity and be an open end challenge for experienced people.
