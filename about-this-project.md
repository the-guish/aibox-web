# About AIBox

This is currently just a proof of concept.

The main purpose of these programming mini games is to play, learn and share. 

It is known there are already a trillion of coding challenge sites and events, even so I think some variations or combinations of their features could lead to something new. 

Lets see some highlights

## confortable tooling
Players will be able to code with their usual desktop tools. 
Code submissions could be done by pushing with git. 
Server runtime environment will be built with docker images allowing more freedom and speed to include new languages or libraries. 

## promote collaboration
A time after release a game will go into practice mode and all the submissions will be public. 
Then any player will be able to fork and improve other submissions. 
Practice ranking will be apart from competitive one. So winner glory will be eternal anyways :)

## smooth learning curve
Games should be designed in a way that is beginner friendly, but having space to grow in complexity and be an open end challenge for experienced people.
