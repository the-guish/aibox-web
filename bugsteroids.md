# Bugsteroids

Your ship is stuck at coordinates 300, 300.

Anyways there are three commands you can still use:

A: shoot

R: turn right 5°

L: turn left 5°


You can start with a simple mission called "oneshot".

After getting it done you could change map from "oneshot" to "random" and see how it goes.
